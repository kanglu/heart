# Animated Heart using Qt with python and PyQt

My wife and I watched the Lighter & Princess (点燃我，温暖你) Chinese Drama in December of 2022. The show featured an ultra smart programmer, and he coded an animated heart (Episode 5 @ 31:43). My wife challenged me to replicate the animated heart. This is my attempt.

# Installation
I only tested this with python 3.10.8

```
git clone https://github.com/kanglu/heart.git

cd heart

python3.10 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you are doing this on Linux or Ubuntu you may need to update your library dependencies
#
# sudo apt install '^libxcb.*-dev'

python ./heart.py

```
